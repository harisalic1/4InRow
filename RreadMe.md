Connect Four / 4InRow
Connect Four is a two-player connection board game, in which the players choose a color and then take turns dropping colored tokens into a vertically suspended grid. Whichever player manages to connect 4 tokens of the same color horizontally, vertically or diagonally wins the game.

The project was done as part of the IT 305 Programming Languages course at International Burch University, and implemented in the Scala programming language.
